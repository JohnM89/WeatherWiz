## Overview
The Weather Dashboard is a dynamic web application that provides real-time weather information for multiple cities. Designed to help travelers plan their trips efficiently, it utilizes the OpenWeather API to display both current and forecasted weather conditions.

<p>

**GIVEN** a weather dashboard with form inputs,  
**WHEN** I search for a city,  
**THEN** I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.  

**WHEN** I view current weather conditions for that city,  
**THEN** I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.  

**WHEN** I view future weather conditions for that city,  
**THEN** I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.  

**WHEN** I click on a city in the search history,  
**THEN** I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

<details><summary><strong>Additional Features and Notes</strong></summary>
<p>

- **Experimental API Calls:** While developing this dashboard, I experimented with additional API calls to enhance functionality and user experience.
- **Occasional Page Refresh Required:** Please note, due to these experimental features, the page may need to be refreshed a few times for optimal performance.
- **Local Storage:** Not sure if I've done this properly, but local storage exists for one previously entered city, however there isn't a history search bar, the page just loads the latest search instead.
- **Weather Details:** Only now realized I haven't included wind speed and humidity, couldn't get it to display nice in the container so I opted to not add but will resubmit if need be!
